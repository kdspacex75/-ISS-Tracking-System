# -ISS-Tracking-System
This project tracks the **International Space Station (ISS)** in real time and gives a simple hardware alert when it passes overhead.   I built it as a learning project combining **Python, Arduino, and basic electronics**.

## ✨ What it does
- Calculates ISS position using Python and satellite data  
- Sends data to Arduino via serial  
- Controls a **servo motor** and **LED**:  
  - Servo moves when the ISS is overhead  
  - LED blinks to signal ISS visibility  
- (Planned) Add an LCD to display “ISS NEAR” with coordinates  

## 🔧 Tech Used
- **Python** (ISS position calculation)  
- **Arduino** (servo + LED control)  
- **Electronics** (servo, LED, resistors, basic wiring)

## 🎯 Goal
This was a small but exciting project to practice **Python-Arduino communication** and understand how real-world space tracking works.
