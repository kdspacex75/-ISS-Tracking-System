# -ISS-Tracking-System
This project tracks the **International Space Station (ISS)** in real time and gives a simple hardware alert when it passes overhead.   I built it as a learning project combining **Python, Arduino, and basic electronics**.

## ‚ú® What it does
- Calculates ISS position using Python and satellite data  
- Sends data to Arduino via serial  
- Controls a **servo motor** and **LED**:  
  - Servo moves when the ISS is overhead  
  - LED blinks to signal ISS visibility  
- (Planned) Add an LCD to display ‚ÄúISS NEAR‚Äù with coordinates  

## üîß Tech Used
- **Python** (ISS position calculation)  
- **Arduino** (servo + LED control)  
- **Electronics** (servo, LED, resistors, basic wiring)

## Operating System Used
Ubuntu 24.04 (Linux)

## üéØ Goal
This was a small but exciting project to practice **Python-Arduino communication** and understand how real-world space tracking works.
